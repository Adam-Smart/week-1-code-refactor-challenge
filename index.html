    <!--Here i have updated all the div tags to use main and section tags. Ive done this to update the code using semantic HTML mkaing it easier for myself and others to understand as it
    splits it up and makes it more clear. It also stands out in the search engines algorythm as it can define whats in the code and can determine the importance.
    I have also added alt tags to each of the images which allows it to be user friendly as the picture now have a brief description so users that are using screen reader can hear what
    the images are.  -->
