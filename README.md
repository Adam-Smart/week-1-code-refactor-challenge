# week-1-code-refactor-challenge

## Description

The motivation of this project is to refactor the existing code provided allowing it to follow accessibility standards and to make the site optimized for search engines. From this project, I learned to add "alt" tags to images and icons to allow the screen reader to read out a description of both the images and icons where showing. I did this so it met one of my motivations which was to add a codebase to follow accessibility standards to allow the page to be usable by everyone. Making the site accessible is a legal requirement but it also improves search engine optimization allowing it to reach more users as it will be ranked higher in search engines. This helps with my other motivation which was to make it optimized for search engines. Doing this allowed me to learn how semantic HTML works allowing me to update the code elements and remove all the "div" tags from the code. Adding the semantic tags allows the code to read much easier and allows other users and search engines to determine the importance of the webpage. 

## Problems and solutions
When I was working on the project one of the problems I ran into was when I changed all the divs the website wasn't functioning correctly this was due to it not being properly linked with the CSS style sheet. To fix this I had to go through the CSS style sheet and remove the "." before some of the elements and this made the HTML link correctly to the CSS style sheet. I had to fix this problem as one of the requirements was to not have the looks of the webpage stay the same as it was before.

Another issue I ran into was the navigation link as the "Search Engine Optimization" was not correctly set up so when clicking on it, nothing happened to fix this I added an id for it as it didn't have one before meaning it had nothing to link with.

## Usage
The website can be used by users by easily clicking on the navigation links at the top of the page which when doing so takes them to the correct part of the page displaying the information. See the image below.
