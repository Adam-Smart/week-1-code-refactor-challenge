# week-1-code-refactor-challenge

## Description

The motivation of this project is to refactor the existing code provided allowing it to follow accessibility standards and to make the site optimized for search engines. From this project, I learned to add "alt" tags to images and icons to allow the screen reader to read out a description of both the images and icons where showing. I did this so it met one of my motivations which was to add a codebase to follow accessibility standards to allow the page to be usable by everyone. Making the site accessible is a legal requirement? but it also improves search engine optimization allowing it to reach more users as it will be ranked higher in search engines. This helps with my other motivation which was to make it optimized for search engines. Doing this allowed me to learn how semantic HTML works allowing me to update the code elements and remove all the "div" tags from the code. Adding the semantic tags allows the code to read much easier and allows other users and search engines to determine the importance of the webpage.
